## Description
A repo to try out different ideas for training and playing with neural networks. Included here is code for a network that recognizes images of hand-drawn digits. The code was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook but modifications have been made so that the data can be trained on any size network. The data to train the network can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/input look for the train.csv file.
